# 👋 Hi, I'm Zaman Lantra

## 🚀 TL;DR
#### PhD in HPC | Ex-Fintech Engineer | Expert in C++/Python & GPU Programming | Passionate about performance, simulation & code that runs fast | Badminton Enthusiast.

##
I thrive on pushing the limits of what is possible on modern CPUs and GPUs. As a PhD researcher in High-Performance Computing with over eight years of experience in C++ and Python, I specialize in building high-throughput, performance-critical systems. My work spans low-latency trading pipelines and massively parallel scientific simulations.

I have contributed to core backend systems for global stock exchanges and developed a C++ domain-specific language that accelerates nuclear fusion simulations across thousands of CPUs and GPUs. My technical toolkit includes MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, HIP, and SYCL. I am also skilled in distributed computing, performance profiling, source-to-source code transformation, and optimization on Linux systems.

I am passionate about solving complex engineering problems, where software performance and scalability matter most. I enjoy working on systems that combine deep technical challenges with real-world impact, particularly in simulation technologies and financial infrastructure.
